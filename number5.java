 //Number 5.
//          Compare and contrast the classic for loop versus foreach. 
//           What are the pros and cons of both sides?

//To compare and contrast the classic for loop and the for each loop, 
//For loops are appropriate loops when you know exactly how many times iteration 
//you want in statements within the loop. For loop iterates a statement or a block 
//of statements repeatedly until a specified expression evaluates to false.
//While the Foreach loop is used to iterate through the items in object collections, 
//List generic collections or array list collections. 
//In case of Foreach the variable of the loop will be the same as the type of values under the array.
// 
//The advantage of using for loop is we can easily modify an array, 
//we can easily get the array index within the loop. On the other hand 
//he advantage of using foreach loop is  you can execute it in parallel by just using 
//a parallel Stream instead of regular stream. It also allows you to filter and map elements. 
//Once you are done with filtering and mapping, you can use forEach() to operate over them. 
//        
//And basically the main difference between for and for each loop is to set the number of iterations manually. 
//In for loop you have to set the number of iteration manually while in for each loop the iteration will be 
//counted automatically as per the length of an array.
